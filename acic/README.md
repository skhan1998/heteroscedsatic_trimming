This folder contains code to replicate the [ACIC data challenge](https://acic2022.mathematica.org/) experiments in Section 6.3 of the paper. Running the script `run_acic_experiments.sh` runs a heteroscedastic trimming analysis on 10 datasets. This generates Figure 3 and Table 4 in the main text, as well as all of the plots in Figure 5 of the supplementary material. 

Note that running the script requires having a local copy of the file `track1a_20220404.zip`, which is available [here](https://acic2022.mathematica.org/data/track1a_20220404.zip).
